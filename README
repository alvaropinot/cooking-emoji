Once I've read [this tweet](https://twitter.com/steveluscher/status/741089564329054208)
from @steveluscher I could not help my self not to write this repo 😈 obviously
with his own tests 😂


## Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/alvaropinot/cooking-emoji

## Create your own recipes!

### like some ice creams!

```js
const recipes = {
  '🍓': '🍧',
  '🍋': '🍨'
};

const cook = recipeBook(recipes);
['🍓', '🍋'].map(cook);
// => ['🍧', '🍨']
```
